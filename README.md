# MovieDatabase
Designed and implemented a database for an online movie streaming company like Netflix. At the back-end, the database manages all of its data in the Oracle database management system. The database stores information about customers, movies, actors, and customer viewing history. At the front-end, implemented a command-line interface to its users (DBMS users) using Java and JDBC.
